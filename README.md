In this game there is paddle that is moving left & right you need to hit
the paddle with soccer ball. When you play this game you need a focus for hit. Tap the screen anywhere than soccer ball will jump towards
upward direction for hitting the paddle!

There is only two chances and if soccer ball doesn't hit the paddle your chance is gone. Also a Score title is given for high Scores. 
Some clouds are moving left and right side, Don't hit the clouds!
