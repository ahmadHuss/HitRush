In this game, there is a paddle that is moving left & right you need to hit
the paddle with a soccer ball. When you play this game you need a focus for the hit. Tap the screen anywhere then the soccer ball will jump towards upward direction for hitting the paddle!

There are only two chances and if soccer ball doesn't hit the paddle your chance is gone. Also, the scoring title is given for high Scores. Some clouds are moving left and right side, Don't hit the clouds!

You can bet your score with any friend!

AdMob doesn't implement but you can use this repository which has all source code, assets, and sprite that can help you to
implement custom things. Like Admob & Leaderboards.

Ownership of the content that I'm uploading all work is my and all assets that used in this project have proper attributions.
